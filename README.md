ALWAYS open VertaUtils and Utilities with Microsoft (R) HTML Application Host. If you do not do so, it will not work.
If the file is an HTML Application then you do not need to open it with the HTML Application Host.

For Utilities. Do not delete any of the .vbs files you see in the folder, they are commands that Utilities run.
